# Dyslexia Detection Web App

A Python-based web application to detect dyslexia traits using handwriting samples and text input analysis, 
with future support for audio-based analysis.

The frontend is built with Streamlit, and machine learning models are used for handwriting analysis.

## Features

1. Handwriting Analysis
   - Upload a handwriting image.
   - Predict dyslexic or non-dyslexic handwriting.
   - Shows model confidence score.

2. Text Input Analysis
   - Type or paste text.
   - Check spelling and grammar corrections.
   - Simulate phonics/pronunciation accuracy.
   - Calculate dyslexia-related traits:
       - Spelling errors
       - Grammatical errors
       - Phonetic accuracy (%)
       - Percentage of corrections

3. Future Audio Analysis
   - Upload audio recordings to extract speech features.
   - Analyze pronunciation, syllable, and phoneme accuracy.

## How It Works

### Handwriting Analysis
1. Resize uploaded image to CNN input size (128x128).
2. Predict dyslexia likelihood with pre-trained CNN.
3. Display prediction score with warnings.

### Text Input Analysis
1. User enters text.
2. Check spelling/grammar with TextBlob.
3. Simulate phonics/accuracy using Word Error Rate (WER).
4. Compute dyslexia-related traits (spelling, grammar, phonics).
5. Display outputs to user.

### Audio Analysis (Future)
1. Upload audio.
2. Convert speech to text.
3. Calculate WER, syllable, phoneme error rate.
4. Display additional dyslexia traits.

## Running the Web App

1. Clone repo:
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd Dyslexia_Detection-main

2. Create virtual environment:
   python -m venv venv

3. Activate environment:

## Notes
- Data may contain biases; not medically verified.
- Audio features to be added in future.
- Handwriting model may have reduced accuracy for unseen samples.
